                identify primary input and output
                use more brackets to protect your code
                chunk code into blocks separated by white-space
                identify blocks of code with a comment above it
                variables declared at top of code, then used within
                user interface needs much improvement (welcome, describe to the user what the hell is going on, thank you for using)
                var goes at the top of a block of code
                keep all the user interface together
                each block of code must have a comment above and at least one comment beside
                missing welcome msg of user interface
                missing explanation msg of user interface
                missing thank you msg of user interface
                use more brackets to protect your code
                each block of code needs a comment above to identify its purpose
                have a var section, then use the var's later on in the code
                keep all (similar code) println statements together
                keep similar code tight together
                put space between different blocks of code
                 
               
                NOTE: 
                Try a print not println when scanning
