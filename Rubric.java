         * Improve the user interface side of your program so it is more evident to the user what is going on.
         * Output is confusing. Make sure the output make sense to the user.
         *
         *
         *Program is confusing (all over the place). Keep similar statements together, work on the logical arrangement of your program elements 
         * Continue to work on the seperation of code (keep similiar code together w/ a comment above the block).
         * Improve your seperation of blocks of code (add whitespace between different blocks of code)
         * Spend more time on the formatting (use of whitespace or indenting). 
         * Just remember the title, summary and program elements belong at the top of the program
         * Each part of the program must have a begin/end statement. Especially Beginning of Program, Beginning of Main, End of Program, End of Main 
         * Use more comments: Specific comments on the side, general comment on top 
         * Use more comments: did you identify the key input and output of the program
         * Use more comments: Each block of code requires at least 1 comment
         *
         *
         * Although your program works, it was a very inefficient use of code. 
         * Need to improve you understanding of programming elements like concatenation, interpolation, operator precedence and member access.
